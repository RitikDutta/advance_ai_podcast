SPEAKER 1 0:00:00:000
Welcome to the deep dive. We're doing something a little different with this deep dive. We're gonna be looking at a whole bunch of fascinating facts and trivia that came from a conversation we had earlier. That's right. And we thought it would be fun to share some of those nuggets of knowledge with you. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:16:160
Yeah, I mean, who doesn't love a good trivia tidbit, right? 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:19:179
Okay, so to kick things off, I have one that just completely blew my mind. Did you know that there's an animal out there with fingerprints so close to humans that they could actually mess up a crime scene investigation? Really? Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:35:240
What is it, a chimpanzee? No. Okay, a gorilla. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:38:020
Nope, it's a koala. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:39:140
Koala. Koalas. Wow, their fingerprints. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:41:659
I would not have guessed that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:42:740
I know. Their fingerprints have like the same loops and whorls as ours, making them almost impossible to tell apart from human prints. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:50:939
So you're telling me a koala could frame me for a crime? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:54:060
Well, I mean, theoretically, yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:57:859
But on a more serious note, this fact makes you think, right? Yeah. I mean, if their fingerprints are so similar, does that mean koalas and humans are like? 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:07:420
Closer than we think. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:08:420
Closer than we think, evolutionarily. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:10:540
It's a good question. Yeah. But it's not necessarily about being directly related. It's more about something called convergent evolution. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:20:260
Convergent evolution. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:21:739
Yeah, where like different species could end up developing similar traits. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:26:260
Oh, I see. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:27:140
Where they live in similar environments. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:28:939
Ah. Or have similar ways of life. Okay, so they both need to grip things. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:33:500
Yeah, exactly. So koalas gripping eucalyptus branches. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:37:140
And humans using tools. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:38:859
Exactly. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:39:700
Wow. And you said this is called? 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:41:659
Convergent evolution. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:42:659
Convergent evolution. Okay, I'm gonna try to remember that one. Yeah, that's a good one. So koalas and humans both developed these super similar fingerprints because they both needed to grip stuff. Exactly. That's amazing. The fact that we can be fooled by koalas fingerprints, it really makes you think about all the challenges that forensic scientists face. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:03:260
Right. Imagine being a forensic scientist. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:05:459
Yeah, yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:06:299
And you find these fingerprints and you think it's human. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:08:500
Right. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:09:340
And it turns out it was a koala all along. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:10:860
It was a koala the whole time. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:12:780
That's wild. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:13:819
Yeah, nature is full of surprises. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:16:259
It really highlights the need for careful analysis. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:20:460
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:21:300
And you know, multiple layers of evidence when you're investigating something. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:25:300
Absolutely. So we've established that koalas are way more complex than we initially thought. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:30:659
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:31:500
Let's move on to the next fact. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:32:699
Okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:33:539
It's a geography question. All right. I think this one's gonna be pretty easy. Okay. What's the only US state that starts with the letter P? Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:43:780
The Keystone State. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:44:819
The Keystone State, yeah. I always wondered where that nickname came from. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:47:900
Well, Pennsylvania obviously comes from William Penn, its founder. Right. And Sylvania means woodlands. But the Keystone part, that comes from its central location, like right in the middle of the original 13 colonies. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:02:620
Ah, okay. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:03:819
It was kind of seen as this crucial link. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:05:699
I see. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:06:539
Both geographically and politically, so. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:08:340
So it was really important. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:09:740
Super important. Yeah, it held this like pivotal position. Wow. When the United States was being formed. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:15:259
I never knew that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:16:500
It's pretty cool. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:17:419
Right. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:18:259
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:19:139
It's amazing how much history is packed into just like. The names of places. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:24:219
I know. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:25:219
Okay, ready for another fact. Hit me. All right, this one's about something a lot of people are afraid of. Okay. Spiders. What's the official name for the fear of spiders? 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:35:060
Arachnophobia. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:36:020
Arachnophobia. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:37:180
Yeah, and it's one of the most common phobias out there. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:39:539
It is, I know a few people who definitely have arachnophobia. And while some fears might seem irrational, phobias can have a huge impact on people's lives. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:50:659
They're not just like, oh, I'm a little scared of spiders. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:52:900
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:53:740
It's a real anxiety disorder. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:55:979
Right. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:56:819
It can cause significant distress, impairment in their life. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:00:539
That's intense. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:01:740
Yeah, people with phobias often go to great lengths to avoid. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:04:699
The thing they're afraid of. Exactly, whatever it is. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:06:580
And that avoidance. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:08:020
Can affect. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:08:860
Can totally disrupt their daily routines, their relationships. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:12:620
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:13:460
Their overall quality of life. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:14:500
That's a really good reminder to be empathetic. Yeah. And understanding towards people with phobias. For sure. Yeah. Okay, ready for another intriguing fact. Let's venture out into space for this one. Sounds good. Okay. What is the only planet in our solar system that rotates on its side? Uranus. Uranus. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:34:620
The ice giant. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:35:459
It's tilted at like. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:36:579
Almost a 90 degree angle. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:37:819
Almost a 90 degree angle. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:39:180
Yeah, which makes it seasons and it's day and night cycles. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:42:699
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:43:540
Totally different from any other planet we know. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:45:019
Uranus, the rebel of the solar system. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:46:939
Right. It's doing its own thing. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:48:860
But how does that extreme tilt affect things like the climate and weather patterns on Uranus? 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:54:779
Oh, it's wild. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:55:939
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:56:779
It's a world of extremes. Imagine this. One pole is facing the sun for half a year. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:01:339
Okay. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:02:180
Constant daylight. Wow. The other pole is in darkness. The kind of tilt just messes with everything. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:09:339
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:10:180
The atmospheric circulation, you get some really bizarre weather. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:13:660
It's like something out of science fiction. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:15:220
It really is. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:16:139
Speaking of unique. Uh-huh. Let's talk about a place that's definitely one of a kind here on Earth. What's the smallest country in the world? 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:23:939
That would be Vatican City. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:25:180
Vatican City. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:26:180
A tiny sovereign state. Right there in the heart of Rome. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:28:939
Yeah. I've always been fascinated by Vatican City. It's such a small area. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:33:500
It is tiny. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:34:339
But so much history and religious significance. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:37:459
Yeah. I mean, it's the center of the Catholic church. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:39:819
Right. And the art and architecture there is just. Stunning. Breathtaking. It's incredible how much. Bear with me. The history and culture and religious influence. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:48:300
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:49:139
Can be concentrated in such a small space. It really is. Vatican City kind of serves as like a constant reminder of the power of faith and tradition. Yeah. And how they continue to shape the world today. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:59:459
Absolutely. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:00:300
We've gone from koala fingerprints. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:02:699
Mm-hmm. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:03:540
To the tilted wonders of Uranus. Yep. To the historical significance of Vatican City. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:09:339
Quite a range. What a whirlwind. And we're just getting started. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:12:300
I know. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:13:180
We've got so many more fascinating facts to uncover. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:15:860
Welcome back to the deep dive. We're on a roll with these fascinating facts and I'm ready for more. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:22:019
Yeah, me too. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:22:980
I'm still thinking about those koala fingerprints. It's just wild. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:26:339
I know, right? 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:27:660
Okay, let's keep that momentum going. Okay. This next fact. Mm-hmm. Really puts things into perspective. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:33:740
All right, I'm ready. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:34:579
Hit me with it. Okay, here it is. Mm-hmm. Did you know that there are more trees on earth than stars in the Milky Way galaxy? 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:42:500
Wait, hold on, really? 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:43:620
Yeah. That sounds impossible. I know, it's mind blowing, but it's true. Wow. Scientists estimate that there are over three trillion trees. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:52:779
Three trillion? 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:53:620
Three trillion, yeah, on our planet. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:55:620
That's a lot of trees. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:56:939
While the Milky Way galaxy has somewhere between 100 and 400 billion stars. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:03:060
Wow, that's insane. So many more trees than stars. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:06:180
I know, right? 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:07:139
It really makes you appreciate the sheer scale of all the forests on our planet and all the life they support. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:13:699
Right, and it makes you think about conservation. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:16:139
Absolutely. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:16:980
Especially with all the threats that forests are facing right now. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:19:779
Deforestation, climate change. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:21:420
Exactly, I mean, each one of those trillions of trees plays a vital role in our ecosystem. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:29:439
It does, I mean, think about it. Every tree absorbs carbon dioxide. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:33:339
Produces oxygen. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:34:459
Helps regulate the water cycles. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:35:860
Prevents soil erosion. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:37:100
Provides habitat. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:37:939
It's incredible. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:38:779
It's so important. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:39:620
I'm feeling inspired to go hug a tree. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:41:579
Yeah, go hug a tree. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:42:459
Speaking of vastness. Okay. Let's talk about something equally massive. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:46:420
All right, I'm ready. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:47:259
What is the largest ocean on Earth? 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:50:180
Oh, that's gotta be the Pacific, right? 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:51:819
You are absolutely right. Yeah. The Pacific Ocean. It's huge. It's mind-boggling how big it is. I know. It covers over 30% of the Earth's surface. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:00:939
That's a lot of water. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:02:060
I know, right? 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:02:980
That's amazing. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:03:800
It's like this vast expanse of water with. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:06:300
Islands and all sorts of marine life. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:08:180
Yeah, you've got the deepest trenches on Earth. Underwater mountains. Incredible biodiversity. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:15:220
So much we still don't know about it. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:16:699
I know. It's a world unto itself. It really is. Okay, ready for another fact? Hit me. All right, this one's about something a little closer to home. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:25:139
Okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:25:980
Our own bodies. Ooh, interesting. Prepare to be surprised. Did you know that your nose and ears never start growing? 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:33:580
Wait, are you serious? 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:34:940
Dead serious. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:35:779
We're all gonna have like giant noses and ears when we're old. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:39:500
Well, not exactly. It's not like they're growing super fast. It's very gradual. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:43:179
But they never stop growing. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:44:620
The cartilage in our noses and ears just keeps growing. And gravity can also play a role making them look longer over time. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:52:059
So it's not just my imagination. My nose and ears are actually getting bigger. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:55:379
They are. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:56:500
That's why. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:57:340
Our bodies are constantly changing. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:58:940
Even in subtle ways. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:00:100
I know, right? It's pretty cool. It's a good reminder that we're all works in progress. I like that. Okay, let's test your mountain knowledge. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:07:419
Okay, bring it on. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:08:379
What is the name of the tallest mountain in the world? 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:12:059
Mount Everest, of course. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:13:379
Yes, Mount Everest. But here's a twist. Do you know that Mount Everest is actually still growing? 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:19:100
Wait a minute, mountains can grow. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:21:019
They can. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:22:139
How does that even work? 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:23:259
Well, the Himalayas, where Mount Everest is located, they're formed by the collision of these two tectonic plates. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:29:940
Indian and Eurasian plates. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:31:259
Exactly. Wow. And that collision is still happening. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:34:620
So they're still pushing against each other. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:36:259
Yep, pushing those mountains upwards. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:37:860
So Mount Everest is getting taller. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:40:019
A few millimeters per year. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:41:620
So millions of years from now. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:43:460
It could be even taller. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:44:860
That's incredible, the forces that shape our planet. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:47:379
It's amazing. Really is. It's a reminder that Earth is constantly evolving. Yeah. What we see today is just like a snapshot. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:56:620
A tiny moment in time. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:57:860
Okay, ready to explore another extreme environment. Let's do it. It's the hottest planet in our solar system. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:05:019
A lot of people would say Mercury, because it's closest to the sun. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:08:100
Right. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:08:940
But I think it's Venus. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:10:379
You are absolutely right. Yes. Venus. It's so hot. It has this thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, which traps heat and creates this runaway greenhouse effect. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:22:059
Yeah, it's like a furnace. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:23:220
Surface temperatures on Venus can reach a scorching 867 degrees Fahrenheit. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:28:299
867 degrees. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:30:340
Hot enough to melt lead. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:32:500
You definitely wouldn't want to be caught on Venus without a spacesuit. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:35:820
No, not at all. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:36:860
It makes you appreciate our own planet's atmosphere even more, and how important it is to protect it. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:41:740
It really does. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:42:740
Venus is a good example of what can happen. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:44:539
When things get out of control. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:45:899
Exactly, a runaway greenhouse effect. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:47:740
Not good. Definitely not good. Welcome back to the deep dive. Hard to believe we're already at the final part of our trivia journey. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:56:059
I know, right? It's flown by. But we've saved some of the most mind-bending facts for last. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:03:340
Okay, I'm intrigued. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:04:779
Yeah, these are the ones that really make you kind of stop and think. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:08:259
All right, lay it on me. What kind of revelation are we talking about? 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:11:860
Well, let's talk about something we all kind of take for granted. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:14:179
Okay. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:15:019
Water. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:15:840
Water, okay. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:16:899
Did you know that clean, drinkable water, the kind we need, only makes up about 3% of all the water on Earth? 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:25:620
3%, that's it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:27:179
Yeah, it's a tiny amount. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:29:059
Wow, I knew most of Earth's water was salt water. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:30:940
Right, the oceans. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:31:779
But I never realized the percentage of fresh water was that low. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:35:179
Yeah, it's pretty shocking when you think about it. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:37:340
It is. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:38:179
The vast majority of it, it's locked up in glaciers and ice caps and underground. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:41:659
And we only have 3% to work with. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:44:100
The water we depend on for everything, drinking, growing crops, industries. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:48:779
It really makes you think about how we use water. It does. We need to be so much more careful. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:53:580
Absolutely, conserve it, protect it. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:55:500
Yeah, not just for us, but for everyone in the future. Exactly, it's a precious resource. Okay, ready for another fact? I am, bring it on. Let's go back to the animal kingdom for this one. Sounds good. Did you know that a group of owls is called a parliament? A parliament of hours. A parliament. I love that. I know, it's so fitting. It's perfect. Like all these wise owls gathered together. Sharing their wisdom. Debating important owl matters. I can just picture it. It's a whimsical name. It is. But owls are fascinating creatures. They are, always been a bit mysterious. I have things that have been around for a while. Let's talk about something most of us use every day. All right. Keyboards. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:34:320
Keyboards, okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:35:159
Did you know that the Korty keyboard layout? 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:38:299
The one we use all the time. 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:39:379
One we all know and love? Yeah. Was actually designed to slow typists down. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:43:539
Wait, really? 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:44:620
Yep. Why would they do that? Well, back in the days of typewriters, if you typed too fast, the keys would jam. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:53:019
Ah, I see. 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:54:080
So Christopher Scholes, the guy who invented the Korty keyboard. The Mark guy. He came up with this arrangement where he put the most commonly used letters far apart. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:03:779
So people wouldn't type as fast. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:05:539
Exactly, to prevent those jams. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:07:860
That's so interesting. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:08:899
It's amazing, right? 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:09:740
It is, and we're still using it today. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:11:940
I know, it's like this legacy. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:13:899
Yeah, from a time when typewriters ruled the world. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:17:220
It makes you think about how human ingenuity can have these lasting effects. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:23:379
Absolutely, even simple inventions. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:25:299
