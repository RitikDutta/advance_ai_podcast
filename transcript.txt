SPEAKER 2 0:00:00:000
Okay, so get this. Today we're diving into the world of someone you might just encounter online. You know, like digitally bump into Riddik Dutta. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:09:599
Okay. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:11:099
And you know what's really cool? 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:12:320
What's that? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:13:380
We've got a treasure trove of information about him that you've sent over. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:17:679
Really? 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:18:519
Like what? It's amazing. We have his online profiles. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:21:280
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:22:120
Like the whole shebang. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:22:960
Wow. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:23:800
Work history, even snapshots of his volunteer work. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:27:160
Wow, that is quite a bit. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:28:800
It is. It's like having all these puzzle pieces just scattered out on a table. And you know, today that's what we're doing. We're putting those pieces together. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:36:960
I like it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:37:799
We're trying to see what the bigger picture is. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:39:240
Sounds like fun. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:40:079
What makes Riddik tick, you know. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:41:799
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:42:619
Both as like a tech person, but also just as a person. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:45:359
Right. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:46:299
So let's just dive right in. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:47:840
It's intriguing to use data like this to try to understand a specific person. Yeah. It reminds us there are real people behind these algorithms and code. 
SPEAKER 2 0:00:57:399
It is. Humanizing all that techie stuff. 
SPEAKER 1 0:00:59:840
Exactly. Exactly. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:01:799
And speaking of humanizing, you know, have you gotten a chance to look over the way Riddik describes himself? 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:08:519
I'd be curious to hear it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:09:680
This guy has energy. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:10:959
Really? 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:11:799
I'm talking infectious, you know. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:13:359
Oh wow. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:14:719
He uses phrases like launch a rocket to Mars. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:17:319
Wow. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:18:159
AML magic. IOT wonder street out of a sci-fi dream. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:22:120
He sounds ambitious. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:23:599
This is a guy who I think it's safe to say doesn't just want to like write code. He wants to build the future. What do you make of that kind of self-presentation? 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:33:680
I mean, I think it suggests somebody who really thrives on ambition, pushing boundaries. He's not just interested in what technology can do today, but what it might be able to achieve, you know, tomorrow. Right. That forward thinking, that forward leaning approach. Coupled with that, you know, what sounds like a palpable enthusiasm is often what drives innovation. Yes. 
SPEAKER 2 0:01:58:040
Absolutely. 
SPEAKER 1 0:01:58:879
You know, you need that kind of energy. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:00:280
It's like he's picturing the end goal, you know, the impossible being made possible before he even sits down to write a single line of code. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:08:560
I love that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:10:000
Now, when I was looking at Retic's self-listed skills, two things really jumped out at me. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:15:120
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:15:960
First, just the variety. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:17:080
Okay. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:17:919
It's mind blowing. He's got everything from deep learning frameworks, 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:20:919
you know, like TensorFlow, 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:22:759
which let's be honest, sounds kind of intimidating. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:25:599
It does. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:27:319
To web development with Flask, and even game design with Blender and Unity. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:32:159
Wow. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:33:879
This guy's like a one man tech orchestra. 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:36:319
That's amazing. 
SPEAKER 2 0:02:37:560
I mean, really, what does that tell you? 
SPEAKER 1 0:02:38:879
I mean, it speaks to a versatility that's so incredibly valuable in the tech world these days. It's like, you know, being a Swiss army knife. You've got a tool for everything. Exactly. And, you know, this kind of like full stack developer, comfortable across all those different layers of technology. Yeah, yeah. They're super sought after. I bet. Because they can see the bigger picture. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:01:879
They can connect those docs. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:03:240
Exactly. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:04:080
They're not just coding in a silo. They see how it all works together. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:06:919
100%. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:07:879
The second thing that struck me was that he lists cybersecurity as a skill. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:12:879
Oh, interesting. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:14:120
Especially these days, right? When you've got data breaches happening practically every other day, it seems like, seeing someone prioritize that, you know, security, just right there on their profile, that's reassuring. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:27:479
Absolutely, absolutely. It speaks to, I think, a proactive mindset. Someone who's thinking about like the potential risks and vulnerabilities right from the get go. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:37:360
From the beginning. 
SPEAKER 1 0:03:38:280
Which is crucial, I think, when you're dealing with, you know, sensitive data and complex systems, which it seems like Ritik is, you know, drawn to based on his background. 
SPEAKER 2 0:03:47:560
And that, you know, that leads us perfectly into that next layer of the puzzle. It's like, you know, mapping his expertise. We've got this, like, you know, key-tailed work history. It's like a trail of breadcrumbs of projects and roles. And then that incredible skills list that we were just going over. Let's see if we can, you know, connect the dots. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:07:439
Sounds good. It's interesting to see how, you know, like, fields that you might not think are connected actually intertwine in somebody's career path. Definitely. Like, take his interest in game design, for example. It might seem a world away from data science and backend development, but, you know. That's what I'm wondering. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:23:480
It's not like he just woke up one morning and said, like, okay, you know, bye-bye joysticks. Hello, databases. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:30:959
Right. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:31:800
There's gotta be something that connects those things. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:33:399
For sure, 100%. Think about it this way. Like, game design often means that you're creating, like, these complex systems. Yeah. With, like, intricate logic. Uh-huh. And problem solving, like, constantly. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:47:519
Right. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:48:360
Those are all skills that translate super well into, like, the programming world. 
SPEAKER 2 0:04:52:560
Oh, interesting, okay. 
SPEAKER 1 0:04:53:800
And then you add in the cybersecurity background. That suggests somebody who understands, you know, like, how systems can be vulnerable, right? How to exploit weakness. That's so valuable when you're building, you know, secure backend infrastructures. Right, right. It's like a detective, you know? Learning to think like a criminal. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:14:000
Oh, that's a good analogy. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:14:959
You're better equipped to prevent and, you know, anticipate problems. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:18:800
I like that. So it's not just about, like, you know, acquiring, like, new skills. It's like building on something. Totally. Building upon that base. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:27:639
100%. And, you know, you can really see that when we look at his time at iNuron. This is where he worked, you know, as both a computer vision engineer and a full-stack data scientist. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:36:360
Those are some really, like, futuristic-sounding job titles. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:40:120
I know. If you told somebody a decade ago that your job was to engineer computer vision, they'd probably think you were building, like, robots that could see. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:49:079
They would. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:49:920
Which, you know, we're not that far off. 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:52:800
But still. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:53:639
It's getting there. Yeah, these are super specialized fields, 
SPEAKER 2 0:05:56:680
but with a lot of overlap. 
SPEAKER 1 0:05:58:399
Oh, really? Yeah. So computer vision, a lot of times, relies heavily on machine learning. Which is, you know, a core part of data science. It's all about teaching, like, machines to see and understand images the way that we do. Like, as humans. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:14:519
So instead of, like, coding a million different rules 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:17:800
for every situation, 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:19:279
you're training algorithms to be able to, like, look for patterns and learn from new data. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:24:199
Exactly. You got it. And, you know, being a full-stack data scientist, especially in this context, means you're not just, you know, like, developing the algorithms, but, like, you're also comfortable deploying them. Okay. Like, connecting them to, you know, whatever that user interface might be. Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:40:519
Basically building that whole, like, 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:41:920
data-driven experience. Wow. And that kind of leads us into, you know, a project that I think is close to Ritik's heart, which is, you know, Dada McGrata? 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:51:720
Dada McGrata, yes. We've seen that name pop up a couple of times. 
SPEAKER 1 0:06:54:759
Right. 
SPEAKER 2 0:06:55:600
In, you know, what we have about him. So it's this Python package that he created. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:00:160
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:01:000
And, like, thank goodness we have this visual diagram that you mentioned. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:04:040
Yeah. It helps a lot. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:05:720
Because it helps us wrap our heads around it. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:07:199
It is pretty complex. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:08:600
So for our listeners, imagine moving data between different systems, being as simple as, like, dragging and dropping files on your computer. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:16:680
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:17:519
Like, no more trying to wrangle, like, incompatible formats. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:21:120
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:21:959
Or spending hours, like, manually transferring information. 
SPEAKER 1 0:07:25:000
You're really hitting on a major pain point. Yeah. Especially in those, like, big organizations. Okay. It's that, you know, like, data silo thing. Yeah. Where you've got different departments, maybe they use different software. Right. Each one has their own database. Right. And then suddenly, the data is tracked. It's isolated. It is, it's isolated. And so a tool like DataMogrado can actually break those silos down. That's amazing. And it can seamlessly move that data between, you know, systems like Cassandra, MongoDB, Firebase, Firestore. Between all of them. It's a big deal. 
SPEAKER 2 0:07:58:600
That's amazing. So it's like he's building a bridge. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:01:319
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:02:160
Between all of these, like, little islands of information. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:05:160
100%. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:06:000
And making sure that the right data gets to the right place at the right time. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:09:319
That's it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:10:160
And that connects directly into his experience with backend development and ETL pipelines, right? 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:15:759
Yes, absolutely. So backend is basically like all of that, you know, behind the scenes magic. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:21:000
Yeah, that we don't see as a user. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:22:360
Exactly. All those servers and databases, you know, the complex processes that make like websites and apps actually work. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:29:199
Right, right. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:30:040
And then ETL, which stands for Extract, Transform, Load. Okay. It's basically, you know, how you take data from one place, you clean it up, you restructure it if you need to, and then you load it into a different system. Think of it kind of like taking, you know, like a diamond in the rough, like from the mine. Okay. And then turning it into this beautiful polished gem that's ready, you know, for display. Oh, I like that. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:53:720
Yeah. So data integrato is like that perfect tool to use during the ETL process. 
SPEAKER 1 0:08:58:960
Exactly. 
SPEAKER 2 0:08:59:799
To make it all go smoothly. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:00:639
100%. It's like smoother, faster, more efficient. Wow. It's like he, you know, like, anticipated that problem in data management and then built a really elegant solution. That's awesome. Yeah. And it's not just coding. It's like, you know, it's problem solving. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:16:919
Right. Like high level problem solving. Totally. I'm starting to see like a pattern here. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:22:960
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:23:799
What's that? Enthusiastic, multi-talented problem solver. It's like his resume is a thesaurus of like all these positive attributes. But here's what I find really truly remarkable. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:34:480
What's that? 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:35:399
There's way more to this guy than just lines of code and these like data pipelines. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:41:480
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:42:320
He's super involved in like doing social impact work with this group called the Robin Hood Army. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:49:639
That's great. 
SPEAKER 2 0:09:50:480
Tell me more about them. 
SPEAKER 1 0:09:51:320
Yeah. I was really happy to see this part, you know. It would have been really easy to just focus on like the technical skills, which are, you know, impressive. They are. But this part, his volunteering really tells us a lot about him as a person. He's not just building like cool tech, but he's using his free time to make a really like, you know, a real difference in his community. That's awesome. And he focuses on, you know, like food and education for kids for underprivileged children. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:19:679
And it's not just like, you know, a one-time donation. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:22:360
Yeah, it doesn't seem like it. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:24:039
Or just like a quick photo op. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:26:279
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:27:120
Like we have photos of him like actually serving meals. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:30:240
That's amazing. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:31:080
Participating in these like food drives. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:33:120
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:33:960
And even like getting his hands dirty, like planting trees. That's great. This isn't someone who's just like, you know, checking a box. Right. 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:41:679
This is a sustained commitment. 
SPEAKER 2 0:10:43:679
It seems like it. To giving back. Yeah. What are your thoughts about this side of Ritik? 
SPEAKER 1 0:10:49:279
I think it's amazing, you know. It tells me he's somebody who really sees the big picture. Yeah. That he's driven by the sense of social responsibility, you know. Yeah. It's about using what you have, you know, and resources to help, you know, uplift those around you. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:07:440
It really is. It's like that saying, you can tell a lot about a person by how they treat those who can do nothing for them. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:14:000
Yeah, 100%. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:15:159
And in this case, it says so much about Ritik. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:18:360
It really does. It paints a picture of someone who is like really aware. Yeah. You know, who sees beyond just like the screen. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:26:600
Right. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:27:440
Who recognizes the impact, the human impact that technology has. Yeah. Who's really trying to make a difference. And to me, that's inspiring. Absolutely. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:36:679
It's a good reminder that, you know, it's not just about algorithms and code. It's about people. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:43:200
100%. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:44:159
So, I mean, we've uncovered so much about Ritik. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:47:200
We really have. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:48:080
His ambition, how versatile he is, you know, his talent when it comes to the technical stuff, and this huge heart of his. 
SPEAKER 1 0:11:55:399
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:11:56:240
So if you had to sum them up for someone, you know, like if they just walked in right now and you're like, okay, this is Ritik in three words, what would you say? 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:04:480
Oh, that's a tough one. I think I'd go with driven, versatile, and compassionate. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:13:000
Oh, I like it. 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:13:840
So driven, because, you know, everything we've seen tells me this is somebody who sets these like ambitious goals and just goes for them. Doesn't stop. Versatile, because he's so comfortable moving between like all these different areas of technology. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:27:960
Really is. 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:28:799
Always learning new stuff. And then compassionate, because, you know, that commitment to social impact tells me this is someone who genuinely wants to make a difference for other people. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:39:240
Absolutely. He's not just building a career, he's building a better future. 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:42:600
100%, through his work, you know, the things he's building. But also just how he chooses to like live his life and like give back. Absolutely. 
SPEAKER 2 0:12:52:440
Now, for everyone listening, I wanna leave you with this. Imagine you could work with Ritik on a project. 
SPEAKER 1 0:12:59:720
Okay. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:00:559
Knowing that you know now. Yeah. His passions, his skills, his ambition. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:04:039
Right. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:04:879
What kind of project do you think would really get him fired up? Would it be something that's like pushing the limits of AI or maybe tackling a really complex social issue? 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:15:600
Oh, that's a good one. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:16:440
Or, you know, what about something that maybe blends together his love for like that game design stuff with his backend knowledge to create, you know, something that's immersive and impactful. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:27:759
The possibilities are endless. And that's like the beauty of what we do here, right? Yes. It's like we've peeled back the layers. Yeah. We've gone beyond just like a resume. Right. And, you know, we've gotten to see the person behind all the code. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:40:440
We've seen the, you know, the enthusiasm that kind of fuels his work. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:45:080
Yes. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:45:919
You know, the huge amount of knowledge that he brings to the table. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:48:679
Right. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:49:519
And the empathy that kind of guides, like everything he does. 
SPEAKER 1 0:13:52:759
Yeah. 
SPEAKER 2 0:13:53:639
It's a good reminder that technology, at the end of the day, it's a human thing. 
SPEAKER 1 0:14:00:519
Yes. 
SPEAKER 2 0:14:01:360
You know, it's shaped by our passions, our values, and that desire to, you know, leave things a little bit better than we found them. 
SPEAKER 1 0:14:07:879
Absolutely. 100%. So, you know, as you're out there moving through, you know, your own digital world, keep an eye out for people like Ritik, the builders. Yeah, the innovators. The ones who remind us that even in a world with all this like complex code and technology, it's the human connection that matters. 
SPEAKER 2 0:14:25:480
Couldn't agree more.
